README

This file explains the only settings that a user needs to edit in the torrc file and how to change the directory location for the Tor relay.

    Address, Memory and Bandwidth Settings:
    The only three settings that a user needs to edit in the torrc file are the Address, Memory and Bandwidth settings. These settings should be adjusted to suit the user's needs.

    Changing the Directory Location:
    If the user chooses a different directory than C:\TorRelay\ for the Tor relay, they will also need to edit the torrc file to reflect this change.
