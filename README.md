README

This file explains the only settings that a user needs to edit in the torrc file and how to change the directory location for the Tor relay.

    Address, Memory and Bandwidth Settings:
    The only three settings that a user needs to edit in the torrc file are the Address, Memory and Bandwidth settings. The Address setting determines the IP address and port number that the Tor relay will listen on. The Memory setting determines the maximum amount of memory that the Tor relay can use. The Bandwidth setting determines the maximum amount of bandwidth that the Tor relay can use. These settings should be adjusted to suit the user's needs.

    Changing the Directory Location:
    If the user chooses a different directory than C:\TorRelay\ for the Tor relay, they will also need to edit the torrc file to reflect this change.
